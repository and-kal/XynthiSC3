## Roadmap

Roadmap is in the making, but I haven't yet gotten around getting an overview of this repo.

One task would be this: »[S]ince SC switched to .scd files instead of .rtf, many of the GUI elements have changed, and the fact that you can’t define classes on-the-fly in SC means that some custom classes would have to be converted to class-like structures like Events. A mildly nauseating set of tasks,« as Bhob Rainey wrote.
